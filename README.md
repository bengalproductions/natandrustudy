This repo isn't automatically connected to the site, so is usually behind by a lot until I find the time to update it.

To use, make a project on [Deta](https://deta.sh) and an API key on [Short.io](https://short.io) and then, create .env file with contents:
```
DETA_KEY="yourdetaprojectkey"
DETA_ID="yourdetaprojectid"
SHORT_API_KEY="sk_FoRISUaCkarfKGG4"
```
Then use command `npm install` to install dependencies and then `npm run buildcss` to build the TailwindCSS file to `/public/styles/build.min.css`
